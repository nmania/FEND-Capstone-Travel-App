# FEND-Capstone-Travel-App


## This project work with retrieving data from 3 APIs in which one of those is reliant on another to work. 
- I built a travel application. It’s common to pull basic data from an API, but many applications don’t just pull the weather, they pull in multiple types of data, from different sources and occasionally one API will be required to get data from another API.
- The project includes a simple form where you enter the location you are traveling to and the date you are leaving.  you will get the weather forecast. 

## features
1. display length of trip.
  - By adding the end date of the trip a user can also see the length of the trip.
2. Display image for the country from Pixabay API.

## Remember that once you clone, you will still need to install everything:
`cd` into your new folder and run:
- `npm install`
- `npm run build-prod ` to generate a dist folder and start a production server.
- `npm start to run` to run the Express server on port 3000
- `npm run test-dev` to run the jest tests
